Puppies and dogs are truly awesome companions. They can provide you unconditional 
love and loyalty, and have a remarkable ability to make people happy and improve 
overall wellbeing. They are playful and energetic, and their presence in our lives 
can encourage us to be more active and sepnd more time outdoors. (PS: I always like
to go hiking with my family's dog!) Moreover, the simple act of petting a dog can 
reduce stress and anxiety, lower blood pressure, and boost our mood. Overall, the 
cannot do without puppies and dogs!
